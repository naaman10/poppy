        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>You can't move for coffee chains in town centres these days– after all that's where the crowds are.</p>
        <p>If you're lucky you may find a dedicated artisan coffee shop tucked away somewhere. There you will find the perfect cup that makes you want to be late for work. The freshest of beans ground individually for your cup, not going stale in a hopper; sumptuous micro-foam on your latte or cappuccino, not weak froth. And the friendly welcome given to those in the know.</p>
        <p>Whether it's the big chains or the hidden coffee shop, people have a choice. For those who are not in the town centre the choice is limited or non-existent.</p>
        <p>That's where we come in.</p><p>Our specially converted van will make sure that you will have the artisan coffee shop brought to you: Our unique 100% Arabica coffee made exactly how you want it – at non-town centre prices. If you don't fancy the coffee then we have a range of fine teas and luxurious hot chocolate. Oh, and you won't be late for work, we'll be there to meet you.</p>
        <p>We'll be delighted to cater for your event whether it's for your community, charity, personal or business – have a look at <a href="#">Book Us</a> for more details</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit us.</p>
