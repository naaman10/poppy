            <p>For nearly four years we owned and operated a successful coffee and sandwich shop in the centre of York. Not only did we hold our own surrounded by the big chains but grew our business year on year. When we decided to sell we already had in
              mind that we wanted to get mobile and take our passion for coffee to the areas of York where it's a rare commodity. There is a real privilege in building a satisfied, well served customer base who then tell their friends!</p>
            <p>Personal and attentive customer service is our top priority but we want the whole experience to be a lasting one and for that we need a great product...</p>

            <p>Our coffee is a blend of 100% Arabica beans all ethically sourced from small grower plantations. We worked with our local roaster  to arrive at a complex flavour explosion of tangy citrus, a mocha hit and a bitter-sweet finish. The beans are not roasted until we place our order resulting in unparalleled freshness.</p>
            <p>Ethical sourcing is important to us so we are delighted with the supply line relationships with the growers. They receive a proper income and we get the highest quality.</p>
            <p>So, customer service ✓ ; gourmet product ✓; just leaves top-drawer equipment...</p>

            <p>...and we know how to use it. The Fracino Contempo combined with our La Cimbali on demand grinder produces consistent, rich espresso shots. Our barista skills turn these shots into coffee heaven. If it's not 100% we don't serve it.</p>
